I recently worked on a project with Bond Hospital, a well-respected institution in its community.

The leadership team recognized the need to move away from making decisions based on intuition and historical trends, which often led to inefficiencies. My role as a Data Analyst was to take raw hospital transaction data and develop a Power BI dashboard that would give management a centralized, bird’s-eye view of their performance.


📖 Data Dictionary (Key Fields)

TransactionID → unique identifier for each transaction
Date → date of the transaction
RevenueAmount / ExpensesAmount → financial metrics
Doctors_FirstName / Doctors_LastName / Doctor_Gender / Specialty → doctor details
PatientID / Patients_FirstName / Patients_LastName / Patients_Gender → patient details
ProcedureName / Category → medical procedure details (e.g., Surgery, Radiology)
LocationID, City, State, Country, PostalCode → hospital location metadata


🌟 Key Insights

Dermatology ($68K), Cardiology ($61K), and Neurology ($59K) were the top revenue specialties.

Heart Bypass Surgery generated $31K with a 31.9% margin.

Preventive care like Pediatric Vaccinations ($34K) showed strong contribution.

Clear seasonal patient visit trends emerged, guiding staffing and resource planning.


📝 Recommendations

Invest in top-performing specialties while monitoring underperforming ones.

Leverage preventive care for both revenue and community trust.

Adjust resources based on seasonal and daily peaks to improve patient experience.

Recognize high-performing doctors while uplifting others for balanced results.


✅ Conclusion

This project reinforced something I believe deeply: data alone doesn’t create value — insights do.

With Power BI, Bond Hospital now has two interactive dashboards that bring together finance, operations, and people data into a single source of truth. Leadership can move beyond gut feeling and make faster, smarter, data-driven decisions.

✨ For me, this is the heart of business analysis — telling stories with data that drive real-world action.
